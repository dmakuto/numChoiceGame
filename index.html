<!-- 
   1.   In this project, you’ll write four functions in script.js. We’ve provided some additional JavaScript code in 
        game.js that will call your functions based on user interactions, but you don’t need to look at game.js and shouldn’t 
        edit it if you want your project to work as intended. As you complete this project, make sure that all of your 
        functions are named exactly as specified so that they can be called correctly when the game is played.
    2.  Create a generateTarget() function. This function will be called at the start of each new round in order to 
        generate the new secret target number.

        This function should return a random integer between 0 and 9.
    3.  Create a compareGuesses() function. This function will be called each round to determine which guess is closest to 
        the target number.

        This function:

        *   Has three parameters representing the user (human) guess, a computer guess, and the secret target number to be 
            guessed.
        *   Determines which player (human or computer) wins based on which guess is closest to the target. 
        *   If both players are tied, the human user should win.
        *   Return true if the human player wins, and false if the computer player wins.

    5.  Create an updateScore() function. This function will be used to correctly increase the winner’s score after each 
        round.

        This function:

        Has a single parameter. This parameter will be a string value representing the winner.
        Increases the score variable (humanScore or computerScore) by 1 depending on the winner passed in to updateScore. 
        The string passed in will be either 'human' or 'computer'.
        Does not need to return any value.

    6.  Create an advanceRound() function. This function will be used to update the round number after each round.

        advanceRound() should increase the value of currentRoundNumber by 1.

        After completing advanceRound(), your Number Guesser game should be fully operational. You should be able to make 
        guesses, see your or the computer score increase correctly, move to the next round, and see the correct round 
        displayed.

    7.  Great work! If you’d like to see the solution, move to the next task. If you’d like to extend your project on your 
        own, you could consider the following:

        You probably calculated the distance from the computer guess to the target and from the human guess to the target. 
        Move this into a separate getAbsoluteDistance() function that takes two numbers and returns the distance, and then 
        use that inside your compareGuesses() function.
        Add functionality to check whether the user guess is between 0 and 9 and alert() the user that their number is out 
        of range. 
        It’s not possible to set a number outside this range with the + and = buttons, but users can do so by typing 
        directly in the input field.
